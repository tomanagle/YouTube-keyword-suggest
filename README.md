## Get keyword suggestions for your video

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:tomanagle/YouTube-keyword-suggest.git`
2. Install dependancies `yarn` or `npm i`
3. Run with your video title `yarn run MY VIDEO TITLE`

For example, if you were going to call you video '*How to cook banana bread*', you would run `yarn run how to cook banana bread`

The output will be in `/output/how+to+cook+banana+bread.txt`. You can then cleanup the irrelevant keywords and add them to your video, or put them in another tool for further analysis.
